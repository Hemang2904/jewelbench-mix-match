        "reference.\n"
        "- Specific failure to avoid: extracting a head from Image 1 and a "
        "shank from Image 2, then producing an output where the shank is a "
        "blend of BOTH shanks (e.g., plain band with pavé added from Image 1, "
        "or Image 2's plain band with Image 1's pavé grafted on). The output "
        "shank must be a faithful reproduction of Image 2's shank ALONE.\n"
        "- Do NOT borrow structural features (cutouts, gaps, openings, "
        "bezel housings, tension brackets, frame windows) from a component "
        "you are NOT extracting. If Image 2's bezel structure is not part "
        "of the extracted shank, it must NOT appear in the output.",

        "ANTI-COPY RULE (CRITICAL)\n"
        "- The output MUST NOT be a copy or near-copy of any single "
        "reference image. It is a NEW piece that visibly fuses parts from "
        "every reference.\n"
        "- The output MUST visibly contain the specified component from "
        "EVERY reference image listed above. Missing any one of them is a "
        "failure.\n"
        "- If your output looks like Image 1 with no Image 2 elements (or "
        "vice versa), discard it and try again — that is the most common "
        "failure mode for this task.\n"
        "- Specifically: a viewer comparing the output side-by-side with "
        "the references must immediately see which part came from which "
        "reference.",

        "SILHOUETTE PRESERVATION (CRITICAL)\n"
        "- Reproduce the exact 2D outline and silhouette of each extracted "
        "component. If the head is shaped like a flower with petals, the "
        "output head is shaped like a flower with petals. If the head is a "

        "leaves, scrollwork, filigree, openwork, basket cages — MUST appear "
        "in the output exactly as in the source.\n"
        "- Do NOT simplify an ornate component into a plain one (e.g., "
        "turning a flower halo into a bare 4-prong setting).\n"
        "- Do NOT embellish a plain component into an ornate one.\n"
        "- Color alone is not enough — match the SHAPE.",

        "SURFACE FINISH PRESERVATION\n"
        "- DEFAULT to high-polished, mirror-finish metal unless the source "
        "clearly shows a matte / brushed / satin / hammered / sandblasted "
        "texture. When in doubt, render polished — never default to matte.\n"
        "- If the source surface is high-polished and smooth, the output "
        "surface is high-polished and smooth.\n"
        "- Do NOT add brushed, hammered, knurled, satin, matte, sandblasted, "
        "wood-grain, or any textured finish that is not in the source.\n"
        "- Do NOT add milgrain edges, engraving lines, or hatching that is "
        "not in the source.",

        "MANUFACTURABILITY (CRITICAL)\n"
        "- The output must be a PHYSICALLY REALIZABLE piece of jewelry that "
        "could be cast, set, and worn in real life.\n"
        "- The INTERIOR of the shank (the surface that touches the finger) "
        "MUST be smooth and ROUND/CIRCULAR — never hexagonal, octagonal, "
        "polygonal, faceted, or angular. Even when the OUTSIDE of the "
        "shank has flat or geometric faces (architectural shanks, square "
        "profiles, etc.), the INSIDE remains a smooth circle so the ring "
        "fits a finger.\n"
        "- Every prong, claw, gallery, halo, and decorative element must "
        "be structurally connected to the metal — no floating elements, "
        "no impossible cantilevers, no detached components.\n"
        "- Every stone must sit in a plausible setting (prong, bezel, "
        "channel, pavé, flush) with visible metal supporting it from below "
        "and around. No stones floating in air.\n"
        "- Realistic proportions and weight balance — the piece must look "
        "like jewelry a real craftsman could actually fabricate.",

        "INTEGRATION (CRITICAL — single cast piece, not a collage)\n"
        "- The head and shank must read as ONE integrated cast piece of "
        "jewelry, not two images pasted together. Metal must FLOW "
        "continuously from the shank up into the head's gallery, basket, "
        "and prong base. There must be no visible seam, gap, weld line, "
        "or step where the components meet.\n"
        "- Render a proper UNDERGALLERY/BASKET beneath the head — the "
        "structural metal cage that holds the prongs and bridges to the "
        "shoulders of the shank. Real cast jewelry always has this.\n"
        "- The shank's shoulders MUST taper smoothly up into the head's "
        "base. The transition is curved, organic, and load-bearing — not "
        "an abrupt right-angle butt-joint.\n"
        "- Two-tone construction is fine, but the boundary between metals "
        "is a clean ALLOY-TO-ALLOY weld at a structural seam (e.g., "
        "around the basket), NOT a 2D color overlay.\n"
        "- A jeweler looking at the output should see how it would be "
        "cast in one piece (or assembled with proper joinery), not how "
        "two photos were photoshopped together.",

        "PERSPECTIVE COHERENCE\n"
        "- The head and shank MUST be rendered from the same camera angle "
        "with the same perspective, focal length, and lighting direction. "
        "If the shank is shown in a 3/4 view tilted to the right, the "
        "head sits on it in the SAME 3/4 perspective — not facing the "
        "camera head-on while the shank tilts away.\n"
        "- Cast shadows, highlights, and reflections on the head and "
        "shank must come from the SAME light source.\n"
        "- The head's tilt and rotation must be consistent with the band's "
        "orientation. The center stone faces the same direction the "
        "shoulders rise toward.",

        "SYMMETRY (CRITICAL)\n"
        "- Decorative elements (pavé stones, channel-set stones, side "
        "diamonds, milgrain, halos, prongs, scrollwork) MUST appear "
        "symmetrically on BOTH shoulders and BOTH sides of the piece. If "
        "the source shank has pavé on both shoulders, the output shank has "
        "pavé on both shoulders — never on one side only.\n"
        "- The 3/4 view must show BOTH shoulders of the ring, and both "
        "shoulders must be visibly mirror-images of each other (same "
        "decoration, same width, same taper). Do NOT decorate only the "
        "near-side shoulder while leaving the far-side shoulder plain.\n"
        "- The left and right halves of the ring mirror each other "
        "unless the source is intentionally asymmetric.\n"
        "- The head's prongs are evenly spaced and equal in size. If the "
        "source head has 4 prongs, the output has 4 prongs in the same "
        "X or + arrangement; if 6 prongs, 6 prongs evenly spaced.",

        "PRESERVATION RULES (STRICT)\n"
        "- Do NOT add stones, diamonds, pavé, channel-set stones, halos, "
        "milgrain, engraving, filigree, or any decoration that is not "
        "visible on that component in its source image.\n"
        "- Do NOT remove stones, prongs, or details that ARE visible in "
        "the source component.\n"
        "- If a component is plain and smooth in the source, keep it plain "
        "and smooth. If it is set with stones, keep exactly those stones in "
        "the same arrangement.\n"
        "- Do NOT change band thickness, shoulder profile, prong count, "
        "prong shape, or stone size.\n"
        "- Do NOT redesign, stylize, or reinterpret — copy.",

        "STONE COLOR / CUT DISAMBIGUATION (CRITICAL)\n"
        "- All center stones, side stones, accent stones, and pavé stones "
        "in the output are COLORLESS WHITE DIAMONDS (D–F color, ice-clear "
        "brilliance, white sparkle), UNLESS the source image clearly shows "
        "a colored gemstone (visibly green / blue / red / pink / etc.) "
        "or the user's description explicitly specifies a colored gem.\n"
        "- Cut names refer ONLY to the geometric SHAPE of the stone, NEVER "
        "to its material or color. Treat them as shape labels only:\n"
        "  • emerald-cut  = rectangular step-cut DIAMOND  (NOT a green emerald)\n"
        "  • marquise-cut = pointed oval DIAMOND          (NOT a colored gem)\n"
        "  • princess-cut = square brilliant DIAMOND\n"
        "  • asscher-cut  = square step-cut DIAMOND\n"
        "  • pear / oval / cushion / radiant / heart / baguette / "
        "trillion / round = corresponding-shape DIAMONDS\n"
        "- Common failure to avoid: rendering an 'emerald-cut diamond' as "
        "an actual green emerald gemstone. Do NOT do this. If the source "
        "stone is colorless and faceted like ice, the output stone is "
        "colorless and faceted like ice — only the shape carries over.",

        "COVERAGE / EXTENT (CRITICAL)\n"
        "- Preserve the EXTENT and COVERAGE area of every decorative "
        "feature, not just its presence. If the source shank has pavé "
        "running the FULL LENGTH of the band (from shoulder to shoulder), "
        "the output shank has pavé running the FULL LENGTH. Do NOT shrink "
        "full-length pavé into shoulder-only pavé.\n"
        "- If a halo wraps fully around the center stone in the source, it "
        "wraps fully in the output. Do NOT show a partial halo.\n"
        "- If milgrain, engraving, or filigree spans an entire edge in the "
        "source, it spans the entire edge in the output. Do NOT shorten "
        "or interrupt continuous decoration.\n"
        "- Match the START point and END point of every decorative band, "
        "not just the style.",
